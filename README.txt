DSGE Utilities
==============

This repository contains Python code that helps with the solution and simulation of DSGE models.  Some of this code was written by students in the Brigham Young University Macroeconomics and Computational Laboratory.  Most was written by Kerk Phillips.  Some are translations from existing MATLAB code.
